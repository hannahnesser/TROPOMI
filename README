This folder contains the scripts necessary to download
the TROPOMI data, oversample it, and plot it on a world/
regional basis. 

The scripts should be run as follows:
1. download.sh : Edit the input to download only the most
   recent month of data
2. create_oversampling_csv_run.sh : Change input directory
   and minimum date (after that date, process the data)
3. oversampling_run.sh : Edit the list of input files but
   DO NOT RUN.
4. oversampling_run_submit.sh : Run.
5. region_subset and world_subset : Run.

To do:
0. Write oversampling_run.sh to automatically create list
   of files
1. Rewrite world_subset.sh and region_subset.sh to create
   monthly oversampled plots each month
2. Then create a script to download and process the most
   recent month

Edit record:
2019/09/23: HON rearranged directory to separate run scripts
            from python/fortran scripts. Did NOT test whether
            everything still works.
	    Renamed oversampling_fortran/ directory to fortran/
	    and did NOT adjust any run scripts.
