This folder contains the scripts necessary to download
the TROPOMI data, oversample it, and plot it on a world/
regional basis.

The scripts should be run as follows:
1. download.sh : Edit the input to download only the most
   recent month of data

   HON 2020/09/22: This script is written only for the standard
   data product; it should not be used for the updated science
   product from Lorente et al. 2020

2. create_oversampling_csv_run.sh : Change input directory
   and minimum date (after that date, process the data)
   and run the script.

   HON 2020/09/22: Changed the python environment and added
   a line for which TROPOMI product should be used. Created
   a secondary python script "create_oversampling_csv_oper.py"
   which has not been changed for use in operational settings.
   Also rewrote create_oversampling_csv.py to handle the
   new TROPOMI product.

3. [SKIP] oversampling.sh : Edit the list of input files but
   DO NOT RUN.

   HON 2020/09/22: No longer need to edit list of files, can
   skip directly to step 4.

4. oversampling_run.sh : Run.

5. region_subset and world_subset : Run.

To do:
0. Write oversampling_run.sh to automatically create list
   of files
1. Rewrite world_subset.sh and region_subset.sh to create
   monthly oversampled plots each month
2. Then create a script to download and process the most
   recent month

Edit record:
2019/09/23: HON rearranged directory to separate run scripts
            from python/fortran scripts. Did NOT test whether
            everything still works.
	         Renamed oversampling_fortran/ directory to fortran/
	         and did NOT adjust any run scripts.

**Notes: Need to write a master script to create dependency jobs
